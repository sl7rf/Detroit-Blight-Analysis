# Detroit-Blight-Analysis

https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasci-capstone/home/welcome

In this project, we will predict building abandonment (“blight”) based on a number of public datasets, including criminal incidents, permit violations, and more. This project grew out of a roundtable discussion with Socrata and city analytics leaders in Detroit, Kansas City, New Orleans, Boston, and more --- these cities shared a common interest in being proactive about identifying buildings at risk for abandonment and taking steps to prevent the harms that arise as a result.
